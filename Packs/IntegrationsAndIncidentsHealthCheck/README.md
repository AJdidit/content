This Integrations and Incidents Health Check content pack enables system users to view all the failed enabled integrations and open incidents details. 
 
With this Content Pack, you can run a job on an hourly/daily/weekly basis. The job will run the checkup playbook that tests all enabled integrations and search for open incidents with errors to get their status and retrieve the error information. Additionally, the job will update the dashboards using XOSAR lists.

##### What does this pack do? 
- The content included in this pack allows you to view all your failed integrations and open incidents in a single incident:
- Run tests on all enabled integrations.
- Search for errors in open incidents.
- Re-run the playbook.
- Link between incidents with the same incident type to copy the user command in case the error continues.
As part of this pack, you will get out-of-the-box, full layouts, dashboards, incident type, and incident fields. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.
